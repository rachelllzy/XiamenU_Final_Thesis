# Project Title: Impact of Internet Finance on China's Large Commercial Banks Performance

## Overview
This research project investigates the influence of internet finance on the performance of China's Large Commercial Banks. It specifically examines how internet finance impacts the five major businesses of commercial banks: deposit business, loan business, intermediary business, international business, and comprehensive performance. The study also delves into the heterogeneous impacts of internet finance on different types of banks, such as city commercial banks, state-owned banks, and joint-equity banks. An important aspect of this research is the analysis of the differential impact of internet finance on bank performance before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Methodology
The study employs both qualitative and quantitative methods to identify the linear and nonlinear relationship between internet finance and commercial bank performance pre and post the pandemic. Financial data disclosed on the WIND database, representing the performance of banks, is used as dependent variables. The transaction scale of internet finance is applied as an independent variable. The research uses panel regression to analyze data from 34 banks. The time interval is divided into two parts: "2012-2019" representing the pre-pandemic period, and "2020-2022" representing the post-pandemic period.

## Social Implication
The findings from this research can advise commercial banks to innovate by learning from the profit model of internet finance and reinforce the bank's inherent advantages, thereby improving the comprehensive performance of China's banking industry. Moreover, it can provide suggestions for financial regulators to further guide the healthy development of Internet finance and deepen the reform and innovation of commercial banks.
